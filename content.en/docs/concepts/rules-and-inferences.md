# Rules and inferences

The previous pages wrote facts directly. Rules and inferences let you describe
patterns over those facts.

A `Rule` asks the graph what is already true. It is a reusable read query over
the current snapshot.

An `Inference` proposes new facts from existing facts. It does not write by
itself. Evaluation produces candidates, and accepting a candidate appends the
new assertion to the ledger.

The short version is:

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Read matching facts | `Rule` + `fg.eval.run(...)` |
| Propose new facts | `Inference` + `fg.eval.evaluate(...)` |
| Commit proposed facts | `fg.eval.accept(...)` |
| Inspect rule shape | `fg.rules.inspect(...)` |

## Start with facts

Rules and inferences work over facts already in the graph. This example keeps
the schema small: `tag_seed` is a direct fact, and `tag` will be inferred from
it.

```python
from kernel.sdk import (
    Branch,
    Entity,
    FactGraph,
    Field,
    Identity,
    Inference,
    Pred,
    Query,
    Rule,
    vars,
)


class User(Entity):
    user_id: str = Identity(primary_key=True)
    tag_seed: str = Field(cardinality="single")
    tag: str = Field(cardinality="multi")


fg = FactGraph.create(schema_classes=[User])

alice = fg.read.ref(User, user_id="u-1")
fg.write.set(User.tag_seed, alice, "engineer")
```

The predicate id for `User.tag_seed` is `user:tag_seed`. Rule bodies use these
predicate ids to match facts. Later docs cover more advanced authoring patterns;
this page keeps the shape explicit.

## Body atoms: the building blocks

A rule, query, or inference `where` clause is a list of body atoms. Each
atom either matches facts in the ledger or constrains the logic variables
already in scope. The same shape covers rules, queries, and inferences.

### Logic variables

`vars(...)` is a context manager that produces fresh `LogicVar` objects.
Each variable has a `$`-prefixed token (`$u`, `$tag`) and is scoped to the
body it appears in. Variables become bound when an atom witnesses their
value.

```python
with vars("u", "tag") as (u, tag):
    ...  # u and tag are LogicVar instances inside this block
```

Use one `vars(...)` block per rule, query, or inference. Logic variables
from one block must not leak into another.

### Entity existence: `User(u)`

`User(u)` is the existence atom for an entity type. It does two things:

1. Requires that `u` refers to an existing `User` entity.
2. Binds `u`'s entity type so later atoms can use the `u.field` shorthand.

`u` must appear in an entity-existence atom **before** any `u.field`
reference; otherwise the SDK raises `SDKDSLError`.

### Two ways to match a predicate

The same body atom can be written in two equivalent styles. The choice is
ergonomic.

```python
# Lower-level: explicit predicate id, no entity class required
Pred("user:tag_seed", u, tag)

# Class-rooted: needs the entity class but reads as object syntax
User(u), u.tag_seed == tag
```

Both forms match the same rows. `Pred(...)` skips the `User(u)` atom and
is useful when the entity class is not imported here, when you want the
predicate id explicit, or when you reference predicates that do not have
an entity-class binding. The class-rooted form makes the entity-type
binding explicit, which is required if you want to use the `u.field`
shorthand afterward.

### Comparisons

The `==` operator on `u.field` is sugar for a field-predicate atom; the
lowered form is the same as `Pred("user:field", u, value)`. Other
comparison operators (`!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) are **not** supported
directly on `u.field`; the SDK raises `SDKDSLError`. To compare a field
against a constant or another variable, bind the field to a logic
variable first via `u.field == var`, then compare `var` — which is a plain
logic variable, not an `AttrRef`.

```text
u.age == age      # OK: AttrRef equality, lowers to a field-predicate atom
age >= 18         # OK: LogicVar comparison, lowers to a numeric guard
u.age >= 18       # ❌ SDKDSLError: AttrRef supports only `==`
```

### Negation: `Not([...])`

`Not([...])` wraps a sub-body to require absence. Variables bound by atoms
outside the `Not` can still correlate inside it.

```python
with vars("u") as (u,):
    no_vip_tag = Rule(
        id="rule.no_vip_tag",
        version="v1",
        select=[u],
        where=[Branch([User(u), Not([Pred("user:tag", u, "vip")])], id="path")],
    )
```

### Branches

A `Branch([...], id="...")` names one alternative path through the body.
A rule with multiple branches succeeds when any one branch matches.
Branch ids are structural; `fg.rules.inspect(rule)` exposes them so you
can address one branch in evidence and what-if surfaces later on.

```python
with vars("u", "tag") as (u, tag):
    important = Rule(
        id="rule.important",
        version="v1",
        select=[u, tag],
        where=[
            Branch([User(u), u.tag == "vip"], id="vip"),
            Branch([User(u), u.tag == "admin"], id="admin"),
        ],
    )
```

`RuleRef` is a body-level reference to another rule and is covered in the
persistence docs.

### Head atoms

The `head` of a `Query` or `Inference` describes what to project. Head
atoms look similar to body atoms but read differently:

- `User(u)` in a body asks "u must be a User"; in a head it declares
  "this entity is in the output".
- `u.tag_seed` in a body is an `AttrRef` for matching. In a head, the
  parallel form is `User.tag_seed(value=tag)` — the field *descriptor*
  (class attribute) called with keyword arguments to declare the
  predicate and value layout of the output fact.

`Pred(...)` and `Not(...)` are body atoms only; they do not appear in
heads.

## Run a Rule

Use `vars(...)` to create logic variables, `Pred(...)` or the class-rooted
`User(u), u.field == ...` form to match predicates, and `Rule(...)` to
name the reusable pattern.

```python
with vars("u", "tag") as (u, tag):
    seeded_tags = Rule(
        id="rule.seeded_tags",
        version="v1",
        select=[u, tag],
        where=[
            Branch(
                [Pred("user:tag_seed", u, tag)],
                id="seed_path",
            )
        ],
    )
```

The `where` clause describes what must be found. The `select` list describes
what the rule returns. Running the rule is read-only.

The same rule with the class-rooted body form is equivalent:

```python
with vars("u", "tag") as (u, tag):
    seeded_tags_class_rooted = Rule(
        id="rule.seeded_tags_class_rooted",
        version="v1",
        select=[u, tag],
        where=[
            Branch(
                [User(u), u.tag_seed == tag],
                id="seed_path",
            )
        ],
    )
```

```python
rows = fg.eval.run(seeded_tags)

assert rows == [
    {
        "u": alice,
        "tag": "engineer",
    }
]
assert tuple(fg.read.get(User, user_id="u-1").tag) == ()
```

The second assertion matters. The rule found the `tag_seed` fact, but it did
not write a `tag` fact.

## Use Query for one-off projections

Use `Query` when you want an ad-hoc result shape without saving a reusable
rule. It uses the same body language, but the head describes the projected
columns directly using the entity- and field-descriptor head atoms
introduced in "Body atoms".

```python
with vars("u", "tag") as (u, tag):
    seeded_tag_query = Query(
        head=[User(u), User.tag_seed(value=tag)],
        where=[User(u), u.tag_seed == tag],
    )


query_rows = fg.eval.run(seeded_tag_query)

assert len(query_rows) == 1
assert query_rows[0]["u"].ref == alice
assert query_rows[0]["tag"] == "engineer"
```

Note the symmetry: `u.tag_seed` (an `AttrRef`) appears in the body for
matching, while `User.tag_seed(value=tag)` (the field descriptor on the
class) appears in the head for projection.

Queries are read-time projections. They are useful for one-off shapes. The
durable authoring surfaces are saved rules and saved inferences.

## Evaluate an Inference

An inference can use the same body and propose a new target predicate.

```python
with vars("u", "tag") as (u, tag):
    tags_from_seed = Inference(
        id="inf.tags_from_seed",
        version="v1",
        where=[
            Branch(
                [Pred("user:tag_seed", u, tag)],
                id="seed_path",
            )
        ],
        target="user:tag",
        head_vars=[u, tag],
    )
```

`fg.eval.evaluate(...)` returns candidate fact sets. It is still read-only.

```python
candidates = fg.eval.evaluate(tags_from_seed)

assert len(candidates) == 1
assert candidates[0].target == "user:tag"
assert candidates[0].derivation_id == "inf.tags_from_seed"
assert tuple(fg.read.get(User, user_id="u-1").tag) == ()
```

The candidate says "this inference can write `user:tag` for this user with this
value." It has not changed the graph yet.

## Accept a candidate

Accepting is the commit step. It appends assertion records for the candidate
facts.

```python
accepted = fg.eval.accept(candidates[0])

assert accepted.accepted_count == 1
assert accepted.written_assertions[0]["pred_id"] == "user:tag"

after = fg.read.get(User, user_id="u-1")

assert after is not None
assert tuple(after.tag) == ("engineer",)
```

This two-step workflow is intentional:

1. `evaluate` explains what could be written.
2. `accept` decides what actually enters the ledger.

That separation is useful when you want to inspect candidates, apply a review
step, compare engines, or keep inferred facts out of the graph until a user
approves them.

## Inspect rule shape

`fg.rules.inspect(...)` shows the structure of a rule or inference without
executing it.

```python
inspected = fg.rules.inspect(tags_from_seed)

assert inspected["kind"] == "Inference"
assert inspected["id"] == "inf.tags_from_seed"
assert inspected["branches"][0]["id"] == "seed_path"
assert inspected["branches"][0]["fallback_id"] == "b0"
assert inspected["branches"][0]["atom_count"] == 1
```

Branch ids are structural names. Use explicit branch ids when a rule has
meaningful pathways that you may want to inspect or configure later. If you do
not provide an id, the SDK still exposes a fallback id such as `b0`.

## RuleRef is not a saved-rule handle

`RuleRef` is a lower-level body atom used when one rule body depends on another
rule. It is not how you run a saved rule from the registry.

For saved authoring assets, use the persistence surface:

```text
saved = fg.rules.save(rule)
rule = fg.rules.load(saved)
rows = fg.eval.run(rule)
```

That topic is covered later. In the quickstart, keep the model simple:

- `Rule` reads.
- `Inference` proposes.
- `CandidateSet` waits for review.
- `accept` writes.
- `SavedRuleRef` and `SavedInferenceRef` must be loaded before runtime use.

## Where semantics engines fit

The default examples here use the native evaluation path. FactGraph also has
semantics options for engines such as ProbLog and PyReason. Those options
change how an inference is evaluated; they do not change the basic lifecycle:

```text
Inference -> evaluate -> CandidateSet -> accept -> ledger assertion
```

Learn the lifecycle first. Engine-specific semantics are an advanced topic.

        target="user:tag",
        head_vars=[u, tag],
    )

assert len(candidates) == 1
assert tuple(fg.read.get(User, user_id="u-1").tag) == ()

accepted = fg.eval.accept(candidates[0])

assert accepted.accepted_count == 1
assert accepted.written_assertions[0]["pred_id"] == "user:tag"
assert tuple(fg.read.get(User, user_id="u-1").tag) == ("engineer",)

inspected = fg.rules.inspect(tags_from_seed)

assert inspected["kind"] == "Inference"
assert inspected["branches"][0]["id"] == "seed_path"
assert inspected["branches"][0]["fallback_id"] == "b0"
```

## Syntax checklist

- Use `vars(...)` to create logic variables for DSL bodies. Logic vars
  carry `$`-prefixed tokens and are scoped to one `vars(...)` block.
- Two equivalent ways to match a predicate in a body:
  `Pred("user:field", u, value)` (low-level, no entity class needed) and
  `User(u), u.field == value` (class-rooted; requires the `User` import
  and an explicit `User(u)` entity-existence atom before any `u.field`
  reference).
- `u.field == ...` is the only `AttrRef` comparison supported; for `>`,
  `>=`, `<`, `<=`, bind the field to a logic variable first
  (`u.age == age`) and compare that variable (`age >= 18`).
- Wrap absence checks with `Not([...])`; the negated body can correlate
  with variables bound outside the `Not`.
- Use `Branch([...], id="...")` to name alternative paths; a rule with
  multiple branches succeeds when any one matches.
- Head atoms differ from body atoms: `User(u)` declares an entity output;
  `User.tag_seed(value=tag)` (the field descriptor on the class) declares
  a field-fact output with the given value layout.
- Use `Rule(id=..., select=[...], where=[...])` for reusable read patterns.
- Run rules with `fg.eval.run(rule)`; running a rule does not write.
- Use `Query(head=..., where=[...])` for ad-hoc read projections.
- Use `Inference(id=..., where=[...], target=..., head_vars=[...])` for
  proposed facts.
- Evaluate inferences with `fg.eval.evaluate(inference)`; evaluation does not
  write.
- Accept candidates with `fg.eval.accept(candidate)` or
  `fg.eval.accept_many(candidates)`.
- Inspect rule or inference structure with `fg.rules.inspect(...)`.
- `RuleRef` is a body-composition tool, not a saved-rule handle.
- `SavedRuleRef` and `SavedInferenceRef` are registry handles; load them
  before passing value objects to runtime methods.
- Semantic engines are evaluation configuration; the evaluate/accept lifecycle
  stays the same.
